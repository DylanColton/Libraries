printMatrix(double[][] matrix):double[][]
  Displays the matrix, formatted, in the console

identity(int size):double[][]
  Checks if the size is valid (between 1 and 10), and returns the corresponding identity matrix

submatrix(double[][] matrix, int row, int col):double[][]
  Checks if the matrix can be reduced, and if it can, generates a new matrix that removes the specified row and column, assuming the arguments are valid
  e.g.:
      (1  2  3)
  A = (4  5  6), row = 1, col = 0 => submatrix(A, row, col) = (2  3)
      (7  8  9)                                               (8  9)

addMatrices(double[][] matrix1, double[][] matrix2):double[][]
  Checks if two matrices can be added toghether, and if they can, returns the matrix of their addition, otherwise returns the identity matrix with matrix.length size
  
subtractMatrix(double[][] matrix1, double[][] matrix2):double[][]
  Checks if two matrices can be subtracted toghether, and if they can, returns the matrix of their subtraction, otherwise returns the identity matrix with matrix.length size

scalarMultiply(double scalar, double[][] matrix):double[][]
  returns the matrix in the argument, where each element in the matrix has been multiplied by the scalar

matrixMultiply(double[][] matrix1, double[][] matrix2):double[][]
  Checks if two matrices can be multiplied in the order that they are entered in the argument, and if they can, returns the matrix of their multiplication, otherwise, returns 
  the identity matrix of matrix1.length size

trace(double[][] matrix):double
  Returns the trace of a matrix

determinant(double[][] matrix):double
  Returns the determinant of the matrix
